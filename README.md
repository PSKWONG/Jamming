# Purpose of the project 

In this project, I am going to build a React web application called Jammming. I use my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

# Technologies used

The technology that I implemented in this project as following: 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* HTTP Requests and Responses
* Authentication

# Features
* Users can search for songs by song title.
* Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried
* Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account
